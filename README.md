# Dictionary
This a Dictionary created using Python3.This Script is called Know it all also nicknamed as Smarty Pants. This Script asks you to search for a word and it provides you it's meaning . This Script searches for the word in a json file namely `dictionary.json`. If the word you searched for does not exist in our Dictionary, or perhaps made a mistake, it will display the next closest word related to it , if still is unable to find, it will display a error message about 'word not found'. You can only exit the running program only when you provide a negative response (such as no, never, nope etc) if provided with a positive response (such as yes, yeah, yep etc) you will be asked to search for a new word and so on.

# How to use it 
1. Paste the Code/Script in the same folder as the json file
2. Execute the Script
3. Search for the word and get it's meaning
