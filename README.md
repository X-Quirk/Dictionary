# Dictionary
This is a simple Dictionary created using Python3.This Script is called Know it all also nicknamed as Smarty Pants. This Script asks you to search for a word and it provides you it's meaning . This Script searches for the word in a json file namely `dictionary.json`. If the word you searched for does not exist in our Dictionary, or perhaps made a mistake, it will display the next closest word related to it , if still is unable to find, it will display an error message about 'word not found'. You can only exit the running program only when you provide a negative response (such as no, never, nope, n etc), if provided with a positive response (such as yes, yeah, yep, y etc) you will be asked to search for a new word and so on, also you can force exit by clicking the close window.

# How to use it 
1. Download or copy the `Dictionary-Know-it-All.py` file and the `dictionary.json` file
2. Place both the above file in the same folder
3. Run the `Dictionary-Know-it-All.py` Script
4. To edit the code i.e `Dictionary-Know-it-All.py` , open it in a Text Editor or the appropriate software you prefer and make the changes neccesary
5. All the logic i implemented are explained as comments in the `Dictionary-Know-it-All.py` Script
6. Not advised to run the `dictionary.json` json file, it's pretty huge

# Note
You need to have the Python3 Interpreter installed to run the script. <br/>
If you want to, you can download the Python3 Interpreter from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).<br/>
